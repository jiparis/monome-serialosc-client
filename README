This is a java client for monome serialosc.
It supports both grid and arc.

How to use::
  
  // look for devices
  MonomeZeroconf s = new MonomeZeroconf();
  String[] monomes = s.getDevices(); 
  
  // connect
  MonomeDevice m = s.connect(monomes[0], "/myapp", 8000);
  // listen for grid events
  m.addListener(new GridListener() {
    @Override	
    public void press(int x, int y, int state) {
	  m.grid.set(x, y, state);				
    }
  });
  ...

Tested with a 40h kit.
